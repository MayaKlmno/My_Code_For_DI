# My_Code_For_DI
This is all my code which I have done for my years in Destination Imagination. When you Open the file you will be able to see the date which I made it. 

Here is the code for my first year of Destination Imagination: 
  Here I was in 8th grade (2022), and we won first place in the global level, as well as a Davinci award, and the Highest IC. Additionally for the states and regional level we won 1st as well as special awards. 

Here was my second year of destination Imagination under the name: Code For Carl
  Here I was in 9th grade (2023), and we won first for regionals and states, and because of a slight mishap in out IC we only got the renissance award and the 5th place. 

The third year, my code is under the name:
  Here I was in 10th grade (2024), in regionals we won (1st place, a renissance, and a devinci), states (1st and a renissance), and lastly globals we won 1st place as well as a renisance award.
